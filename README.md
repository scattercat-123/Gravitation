# Gravity Simulation - https://gravitation-complex.web.app/

A simple interactive gravity simulation implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project simulates a ball affected by gravity and other dynamic elements such as wind and bounciness. The simulation features customizable parameters and interactive controls.

## Features

- **Customizable Parameters:**
  - Weight
  - Gravity
  - Distance
  - Wind Speed and Direction
  - Bounciness
- **Dynamic Elements:**
  - Toggle multiple balls
  - Wind effect from a specific direction
  - Ball trails for a visually appealing motion effect
- **Interactive Controls:**
  - Real-time updates for ball color
  - Start/Stop simulation toggle
  - Reset simulation
- **Audio Feedback:**
  - "Boing" sound effect when the ball bounces.

## How to Use

1. **Start Simulation:**
   - Click the "Start Simulation" button to begin.
   - The button toggles to "Stop Simulation" during runtime.
   - Pressing "Stop Simulation" resets the simulation.

2. **Adjust Parameters:**
   - Update weight, gravity, distance, and bounciness via the input fields.
   - Change the ball's color in real time using the color picker.
   - Adjust wind speed and toggle wind from a specific direction.

3. **Toggle Features:**
   - Enable or disable multiple balls with the toggle.
   - Add wind effects from a specific direction using the range slider.

4. **Watch the Trail:**
   - Observe the trail left by the ball for a smooth visual effect.
